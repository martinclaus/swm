CHANGELOG:

* initial conditions are now read from file
* implemented forcing input constant in time
* implemented lateral mixing parameterization by Bryan (1969) as used in
  Greatbatch et al 1995
* implemented quadratic bottom friction but left linear friction as an option
* created header file model.h to change model physics
* changed from linear friction to quadratic friction
* streamfunction implemented in diagnostics module
* H_u, H_v and H_eta introduced (linear inetrpolation of H on the three grids)
* Nt replaced by run_length in namelist. Now Nt = int(run_length/dt) in initVars
* r and tau_0 added to namelist
* tau_x is only calculated on non-land u grid points to avoid infinity values
* Bugfix: lat_v instead of lar_u was used to calculate tau_x
* changed algorithm to calculate landmasks. Now using FORALL instead of nested
  DO with IF
* new modules:
  - io --> diag_module : contains output routines for H, eta, u, v, ...
  - timestep_module : contains the heaps scheme and initializations thereof
  - varset_module : the main module, namelist input, allocation / initialization
* namelist input (in varset_module.f90, model.namelist)
* switch for periodic boundary conditions in lon-direction
* use ip1, im1, ... everywhere
* time index l is now a global integer variable called itt
* some renaming

TODO:

* STYLE: Contains in modules vs. separate functions?
* restarting
* check for stability criteria
* time dependent forcing

LATER:

* Documentation
* averaging routines
* variance routines
